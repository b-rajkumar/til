# ENGLISH COMMUNICATION SKILLS

## CHAPTER - 1: Code and Content of Communication Skills

### Summary:

- Communication content: Communication skills start with a clear understanding of what to communicate. What do we really want to get across and in how detailed a manner? Are they stray thoughts and ideas or well-organized and sequenced concepts, events, achievements, developments and ideas? Are we communicating our own thoughts and feelings or are we encoding and transmitting the message, thoughts, ideas of another party, say that of a chief executive officer (CEO), planning chief, team leader or an employer?

- As a present-day business communicator,one can choose how to deliver his or her message. Choosing the right delivery channel should be a well- considered decision. Sometimes a written message succeeds whereas an oral message may fail to have the desired effect. On another occasion, it may be more appropriate to talk to the person rather than put the message in writing.

- The sense of timing is also very important in any communication.It has to be on time, at the right moment. It should not be too early or too late. Human memory is short. The notice for a meeting or an announcement about an impending event, therefore, cannot be months or even weeks in advance, and that too without further reminders.

- Technology in general, and that relating to communication in particular, is changing fast. The conventional methods of coding, recording and transmitting messages are giving place to new methods. The contours of communication are constantly changing, thereby providing new options to the communicator.

- Effective use of non-verbal communication through body language,postures and gestures, attire, appearance, handshake, smile, behaviour and example also needs conscious effort.

- The development of communication skills is a continuous process.It comes from adapting a mix of approaches. It results from not only theoretical study and bookish knowledge, but also from observation, practice and real life handling of situations.

- Languages are codes.One can define code as any group of symbols that can be structured in a way that is meaningful to another individual. All languages, including the English language, is a code—it contains element that are organized in a meaningful order. A code has a group of elements (vocabulary) and a set of procedures for combining these elements meaningfully (syntax).

### Keywords:

- Technical skills: These relate to knowledge, proficiency, expertise, speed,
  accuracy, and the like. These are often specific to the area of operation.

- Conceptual skills: These are relatively higher order skills. They include
  vision building and strategy formulation skills, conflict management skills,
  problem solving skills and decision-making skills.

- Human skills: These are associated with networking and managing
  relationships. These would include writing, speaking and presentation skills,
  motivational skills and team building skills.

## CHAPTER - 2: Stimulus and Response of Communication Skills

### Summary:

- Communication is a process that involves certain distinct steps. In its simpler
  form, it relates to stimulus and response. The stimulus arises from the
  communicator and the receiver responds. Communication is not complete
  till the message conveyed by the sender is properly understood by the
  receiver. Any communication process should necessarily have three
  elements—sender, receiver and the message.

- The starting point of any communication is the existence of a message. The
  process of communication starts with a purpose. There is an underlying
  idea that has to be put across. This idea is developed into a message. The
  sender gives shape to the idea he wants to communicate.

- Communication takes place through various methods and channels. The
  three main methods of communication are oral or verbal communication,
  written communication and the non-verbal communication.

- Oral communication refers to the spoken word. It takes the form of sounds
  and words. Starting out as a struggle by the early man, oral communication
  has had a long journey. It has developed across different regions, cultures,
  countries and continents.

- Written communication is another powerful method of communication.
  History is replete with instances where a piece of writing was involved in
  events of great significance—in love, war, peace, unions and betrayals.

- The third method of communication relates to non-verbal communication,
  which is neither oral nor written. While oral communication thrives on listening
  and the written communication thrives on reading, the non-verbal
  communication thrives on observation.

- Visual communication is affected through pictures, graphs and charts, as
  well as through signs, signals and symbols. They may be used either
  independently or as an adjunct to the other methods of communication.

- Audio-visual communications are highly skill oriented. They are preplanned,
  developed with care and are often delivered at formal and structured sessions.
  This method of communication is particularly useful in fostering learning and
  in classroom sessions.

- Sign language is a system of communicating, with people who are hearing
  impaired, by using hand movements rather than spoken words. A signal is a
  sound or a movement that people make to give others information, instruction
  or warning. A signal is also understood as an indication that something exists
  or something is about to happen.

  ### Keywords:

- Encoding: Encoding would involve choosing the right words, expressions,
  phrases, charts and pictures in order to facilitate complete and clear
  expression of the idea.

- Decoding: Decoding relates to reading, listening, viewing, understanding
  and interpretation of the message.

- Oral communication: Oral communication refers to the spoken word. It
  takes the form of sounds and words.

- Non-verbal communication: Non-verbal communication may take any
  of the following forms—body language, gestures, postures, appearance,
  personal space, codes, signs and signals, facial expressions, timings, examples
  and personal behaviour.

- Sign: A sign is a mark traced on a surface or an object with a view to
  indicate a particular meaning.

- Signal: A signal is a sound or a movement that people make to give others
  information, instruction or warning.
