# ENGLISH COMMUNICATION SKILLS

## CHAPTER - 1 : Code and Content of Communication Skills

### Summary:

- Communication content: Communication skills start with a clear understanding of what to communicate. What do we really want to get across and in how detailed a manner? Are they stray thoughts and ideas or well-organized and sequenced concepts, events, achievements, developments and ideas? Are we communicating our own thoughts and feelings or are we encoding and transmitting the message, thoughts, ideas of another party, say that of a chief executive officer (CEO), planning chief, team leader or an employer?

- As a present-day business communicator,one can choose how to deliver his or her message. Choosing the right delivery channel should be a well- considered decision. Sometimes a written message succeeds whereas an oral message may fail to have the desired effect. On another occasion, it may be more appropriate to talk to the person rather than put the message in writing.

- The sense of timing is also very important in any communication.It has to be on time, at the right moment. It should not be too early or too late. Human memory is short. The notice for a meeting or an announcement about an impending event, therefore, cannot be months or even weeks in advance, and that too without further reminders.

- Technology in general,and that relating to communication in particular,is changing fast. The conventional methods of coding, recording and transmitting messages are giving place to new methods. The contours of communication are constantly changing, thereby providing new options to the communicator.

- Effective use of non-verbal communication through body language,postures and gestures, attire, appearance, handshake, smile, behaviour and example also needs conscious effort.

- The development of communication skills is a continuous process.It comes from adapting a mix of approaches. It results from not only theoretical study and bookish knowledge, but also from observation, practice and real life handling of situations.

- Languages are codes.One can define code as any group of symbols that can be structured in a way that is meaningful to another individual. All languages, including the English language, is a codeâ€”it contains element that are organized in a meaningful order. A code has a group of elements (vocabulary) and a set of procedures for combining these elements meaningfully (syntax).
